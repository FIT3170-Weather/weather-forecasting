## Project Overview
This repository hosts all the machine learning components of the CliMate project. It includes Jupyter notebooks used for gathering weather data, training machine learning models for weather forecasting, and contains the exported datasets and models that will be utilized in production to make weather forecasts. 

This repository serves as the central hub for all machine learning-related activities within CliMate's project, and all further development, enhancements, and improvements can be managed and done over here.

Go through the remaining sections of this readme to set up the project and get started with contributing.

## Software Requirements

To run this project, you'll need the following software and dependencies:

- **Programming Language**: Python 3.10.8 (Only tested for python version 3.10)
- **Libraries and Frameworks**:
  - TensorFlow
  - Keras
  - Scikit-learn
  - OpenMeteo
  - Requests
  - NumPy
  - Seaborn
  - Pandas
  - Matplotlib

- **Tools**:
  - Jupyter Notebook

More detailed requirements for python dependencies are available in the requirements.txt file.

## Hardware Requirements
For development, a normal laptop is sufficient. However, itâ€™s better if you have a laptop or workstation equipped with an NVIDIA graphics card to train the models more efficiently. If you plan to work with GPUs for machine learning model training, ensure that the correct GPU versions of CUDA and cuDNN are available. If you don't have a powerful laptop, connecting to a cloud GPU runtime can be helpful to run the model training and development on the cloud.

## Setup and Installation Instructions
Complete the following steps to complete the software setup of the project.

1. Clone this repository:
    ```sh
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2. Make sure all software and hardware requirements are setup as mentioned earlier like *Jupyter Notebook*.
    ```sh
    pip install jupyter
    ```
    
3. Install all the Python dependencies using ```requirements.txt``` 
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    
4. Start a jupyter notebook server to start working with the notebooks in this project.
    ```sh
    jupyter notebook
    ```

## Usage
```sh
./wc.exe [OPTION]... [FILE]
```

## How to Run & Train Models
This repository contains the ```/dataset```, ```/models```, and ```/notebooks``` directories.

1) /notebooks
    - Contains two .ipynb notebooks - ```Fetch_Weather_Data_For_Location.ipynb``` and ```LSTM_Weather_Forecast_Model.ipynb```.
    - ```Fetch_Weather_Data_For_Location.ipynb```:
      - Fetches historical (hourly) temperature, humidity, dew point, rain, pressure, wind speed, and wind direction data for a specific location.
      - This notebook retrieves the required data to train the model, so this notebook should be run before ```LSTM_Weather_Forecast_Model.ipynb```.
      - Refer to the ```/locations``` endpoint in the ```forecast-api``` repository for an exhaustive list of location codes.
      - Refer to the in-line comments and print statments to learn more about what each cell does.
      - Before running the cells, ensure that the cells tagged with ```#TODO``` are modified accordingly.
      - ``` 
        # TODO: Change location code
        location_code = ```johor-bahru```
      - ```
        # TODO: Change to specific location's latitude and longitude
        ```latitude```: 1.4655,
        ```longitude```: 103.7578,
      - Create the corresponding file under ```/datasets```, named according to the location code (e.g. ```johor-bahru```). This is where the dataset used for machine learning training is stored.
      - Run all cells.
      - A new ```.csv``` file that contains this historical data should be expected in this newly created file. 
    - ```LSTM_Weather_Forecast_Model.ipynb```:
      - This notebook contains the implementation of the LSTM neural network used to predict weather data for one particular location.
      - This model currently predicts temperature, humidity, dew point, rain, pressure, wind speed, and wind direction based on the historical data generated from ```Fetch_Weather_Data_For_Location.ipynb```, and the LSTM model in this notebook.
      - Refer to the in-line comments and print statments to learn more about what each cell does.
      - Before running the cells, ensure that the cells tagged with ```#TODO``` are modified accordingly.
      - ``` 
        # TODO: Change location code
        location_code = ```johor-bahru```
      - Create the corresponding folder under /models, named according to the location code (e.g. ```johor-bahru```). This is where the model is stored.
      - Run all cells.
      - Note that it takes approximately 1-2 hours to train one model, depending on the device being used.
      - A new ```model.h5``` and ```scaler.pkl``` file should be expected in this newly created file. The ```model.h5``` contains the trained model; the ```scaler.pkl``` contains the Scaler object to help denormalise values of the output layer.
    - Note that all the steps above only train **ONE** model for **ONE** location. Repeat these steps for other desired locations.
2) /datasets
   - This directory contains all historical data used to train the models.
   - Subfolders, each named according to location codes, store a ```.csv``` file that represent historical data for each location.
   - These subfolders should be created before ```Fetch_Weather_Data_For_Location.ipynb``` is run.
   - Ensure these subfolders are populated with the correct ```.csv``` file before running ```LSTM_Weather_Forecast_Model.ipynb```.
3) /models
   - This directory contains all the trained LSTM models.
   - Subfolders, each named according to location codes, store a ```model.h5``` file that represent a trained model for each location.
   - These subfolders should be created before ```LSTM_Weather_Forecast_Model.ipynb``` is run.
   - The ```scaler.pkl``` will also be found here after running ```LSTM_Weather_Forecast_Model.ipynb```. This is needed to de-normalise the values in the output layer. 
   - **IMPORTANT:** Ensure that this repository (```weather-forecasting```) resides in the same directory as the ```forecast-api``` directory (i.e. they have the same parent directory). This is beacause ```/forecast``` endpoint in ```forecast-api``` searches for the models in ```/models``` using absolute paths.

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

Developers might encounter the following common issues:

- **Dependency Installation Issues**: You may face problems when installing machine learning dependencies. The best sources for solving these issues are ChatGPT and StackOverflow, where you can find solutions and troubleshooting tips from the community.

- **Missing Files for Machine Learning Packages**: Sometimes, you might encounter issues where files are missing for machine learning packages. In such cases, the most effective way to resolve the problem is to reinstall the packages.

## Additional Notes
- This project has only been tested on python version 3.8
- It is inevitable that you will encounter dependencies issues and you will need to play around with the version. If there are any resulting version changes, please update them in the requirements.txt file. This is so that the whole team works with the same versioning.
